# Bank Tech Test

Tech Test at Makers Acedemy

## Approach

I've organised my work using the process stages below.

* Read - Read the requirements and ask questions.

* Plan - Sketch out user interactions, and objects behaviour.
* Test - Write tests to describe the behaviour required.
* Implement - Write code to pass the tests.

* Refactor - SOLID, SRP etc.
* Commit - Regular commits on green, with clear commit messages.
